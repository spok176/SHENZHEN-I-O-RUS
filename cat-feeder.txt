Hey there :)

Lisa told me about you and said you could help me.

It’s strange, but I brought my cats with me here. I don’t know why I thought I would have time to take care of them! Of course, they are so cute.

They need to be fed different foods and not overfed. Valence eats fish and Isotope likes duck.

Should be easy for someone with your abilities :)

Valence and Isotope say thank you :)

Maybe soon I will have something more serious for you...
