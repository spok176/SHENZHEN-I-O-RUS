Subject: Precision food scale

Are you aware of the system of 精准饮食 (precise dieting)? This trend, which originated right here in China, has people across the globe measuring down to the milligram what they put in their bodies based on the ancient principles of 陰 (yin) and 陽 (yang). Actually, my fiancé 小美 (Xiaomei) and I have been trying it for the past month or so ourselves. It really boosts our stamina! I believe a portable food scale aimed at the precise dieting community would do quite well.

Simple. We can include a tare function to zero the display value when power button is pressed.

Splendid work. This truly is the essence of 精准饮食 in electronic form and another great example of the confluence of ancient wisdom and modern technology. I am excited not only to introduce this product to the world but also for 小美 and I to use it ourselves. :)

Whoops! Sorry, I know not everyone here can read characters… 小美 is my girlfriend Xiaomei. :)
