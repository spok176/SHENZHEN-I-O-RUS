The increase in extreme weather events across the globe has resulted in the need for innovations in food security. Recent advances in nutritional technology have allowed for a variety of meat-like products to be assembled out of a common substrate. A portable meat production station could be an effective solution in the recovery period after initial emergency supplies have been used.

I have sourced some initial meat product designs that we can use to get started.

Not sure I’d put this stuff in my mouth no matter how dire the emergency…

I sampled some of the meats from this product and found them all quite delicious!

Carl, you should really give it a try.
