* *radio-rx* is a non-blocking XBus input connected to a radio receiver.
* *power-0*, *power-1*, and *power-2* are simple outputs connected to high-power switches that control industrial equipment.
* When a data packet is received over the *radio*, read it and execute the corresponding command in the following table:

##############

| -1 | keep alive | do nothing
-------------------------------------------------------------
| 0  | power off  | read another value and turn off that output
-------------------------------------------------------------
| 1  | power on   | read another value and turn on that output

* Turn off all *power* outputs when 5 or more time units have elapsed without receiving a data packet.
