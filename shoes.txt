Subject: Would you believe it?

So last night I met a designer for a major international athletic wear company. She was in Shenzhen to tour some factories. We had a really good chat, and we went and got a couple drinks together, and well, you know how it goes. One thing led to another, and, to turn a long story short, soon enough we had…

A product idea!!!!!!!

Specifically: Automatic color-changing running shoes. Everyone loves brightly colored shoes, but matching them to outfits can be a pain. Shoes made from e-textiles could adjust to the rest of your outfit automatically! Their design team sent over some color data tables to get us started.

This is actually pretty cool, Joe. Maybe even more kinds of clothing could be next after shoes?

Personally I’m thinking we could apply it to tracksuits next. It’d be sweet if I could have a different color for every day of the week!
