Subject: Shenzhen Days: The point of it all
From: 刘畅 <tilly88@words.creation>

So I’ve talked about the scale of things here, the capacity in all of these factories and ports and markets, and I’ve asked: Where’s all this, you know, going? Not to get all existential on you, but it’s an important issue, and one that tends to crop up after big economic strides. In some sense, yay, we did it! After lot of hard work and sacrifices, we’ve secured a hugely important place in the world!

So now what?

Call me some kind of nutter but engines of creation like these, the ones we have here, just haven’t existed before at this scale. It’s only now dawning on us what could be done with them if we started coordinating them all. What if someone with some imagination were to start doing that? Putting the whole city to work on something together. What could you build that way? 

Something gigantic and amazing. Or something gigantic and scary. Maybe a bit of both?

Let’s ponder on that one for a bit.

Yrs,
Tilly
