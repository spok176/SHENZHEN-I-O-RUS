Subject: The final step
From: 孙昊天 <sun@avalon.avalon>

First of all, I would like to thank the NETHUNS team for its remarkable efforts. We have reached the culminating moment for the project, and I am about to initiate the final step.

Before I do, I want to address the concerns some of you have brought to me privately. Progress, especially the radical kind we are making here, can indeed be dangerous. There’s a reason I had to start my own country to get this far: No existing government would allow such an experiment on their soil. That said, I think the case for optimism here couldn’t be stronger. This team has achieved so much already and there is no reason to doubt the science.

While the NETHUNS neural computing apparatus suspended in the water below the city will become the new home of my consciousness, I do not expect things to change much at first. After all, we are beginning with an exact replica of my brain structure. I will continue to run things as I always have, with a steady hand and an open-minded eye towards scientific development and discovery.

The longer term, of course, is more difficult to predict. I expect work on NETHUNS to continue even after I am uploaded to it, both to add to our knowledge and to add capacity. From there, we will determine the next steps together.

I would like each of you to sign off below to indicate you believe your section is ready and prepared to begin the upload.

Sun Haotian
President, Avalon City

Processors are running hot, very close to 100%. Have we heard anything?

It’s consuming massive amounts of power and nutrition. The activity is a positive sign, but it’s difficult to tell if the patterns correspond to Sun’s brain.

It probably needs some time to stabilize.

Usage is not leveling off at all, still near full capacity. Irina’s probably right... Sun needs to learn to think again using all of his new systems. Unfortunately, there’s no saying how long this adjustment process might take.

Need to figure out a way to measure this.

I’m sure we’ll hear something in due time. For now, I am officially closing the NETHUNS project. Kamran will continue to monitor Sun’s brain; the rest of you should move onto something else after taking a short break. Feel free to pursue whatever is interesting to you.

If Sun’s absence is prolonged, citizen-employees may ask you if you know anything about what happened to him. I can take care of all messaging around this situation, so refer them to me if you wish. Alternately, you may let them know that Sun is not gone, just sleeping, and he is waiting to awaken again when he is ready.

That is all, and once again, thank you.
