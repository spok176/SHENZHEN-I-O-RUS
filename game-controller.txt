Subject: Little help?
From: Carl Tesky <carl@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

I’m wrapping up a project to make a game console and could use some assistance. Before you get too excited, it sounds *far* more fun than it actually is… the “console” is just a tiny super-cheap box we’re making for SleepCUBES, the big Japanese capsule hotel chain, to stick in every pod. The games’ll just be some free dross they find, I’m sure.

At any rate, I’ve got it mostly done, I just need a module for the little wireless controller that comes with it. I ping you, you tell me what’s going on. Nothing much more than that.

Thanks mate, I owe you one. You’ve just helped make thousands of dead-tired salarymen marginally happier. That is, if they actually find the console and use it to play a game before passing out…
