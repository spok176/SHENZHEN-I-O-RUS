Hey, how’s life in Avalon City? You solve all of humanity’s problems yet?

Things here at Longteng are mostly the same. That’s probably not surprising.

Wang Yonghong, who was apparently our CEO this whole time-- did you know that? Anyway, he retired. Never heard so much as a peep from him, so it’s all the same as far as I can tell. Lili is the CEO now and she’s doing a pretty bang-up job. Joe was promoted to her old spot and he’s doing pretty well too. 

David moved back to San Francisco with his wife. Last I heard he's a consultant who tells American companies how to adapt their products for the Chinese market. I suppose we’ll see how that goes.

J’s still the head of the engineering department. His daughter made a couple more games that everyone here got hooked on all over again so it’s probably a good thing she’s off to college now.

As for me, well, I'm alive. The company’s grown quite a bit since you left, but they’re hiring mostly homegrown engineers now. These days I’m just the gibbering pet Englishman in the corner whilst the rest of the team go on with the business of making products, taking over the world, etc.

Take care out there while you’re doing your important work and don’t let Mr. Sun get you down. Ta!
