As promised, I have a serious job for you :)

These will be custom displays to report current status of each component for monitoring and control of my thorium reactors.

A bit more interesting than cats, maybe?

All,

Several years ago I met a brilliant young scientist who told me the future of energy was in thorium-based nuclear power. I was skeptical, to say the least.

Today I could not be more happy to have been proven wrong, and in so short a time. With Avalon City’s first liquid fluoride thorium reactor coming online today and many more on the way, please join me in giving Dr. Kurchatova a big hand for her stunning achievements.
