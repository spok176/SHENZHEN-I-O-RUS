The BARON VON SCHNAPPS is in the house y’all!! I was out drinking last night and met someone from the company that owns this brand. There’s a drinking game they’re promoting that’s hella fun and off the rails!! I made a deal to supply them with little personal scorekeepers they can give away at their events.

Wait, what’s the game? What counts as a point? What would be a foul?

Surely not individual drinks…

If you can’t remember the rules of the game you were playing, how sure are you that you actually made the deal?

It’s very tasty stuff, come try some!
