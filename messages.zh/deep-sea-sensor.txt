Subject: Ocean monitoring system
From: Wu Lili 吴丽丽 <wulili@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

We’ve entered into an agreement to produce some deep sea sensing equipment for a complete ocean monitoring system. Each station will have passive sonar and magnetic anomaly detection sensors recording continuously, along with a radio uplink for remote review. This probably goes without saying, but these need to be robust and reliable.

Well, this is an occasion for some pride: Mr. Sun very specifically praised “Longteng engineering” when he took delivery of these components. Let’s give ourselves a pat on the back! I feel like we’re going to play a big role in his future plans.
