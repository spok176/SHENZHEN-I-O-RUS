Dear consumer,

If you bought a self-driving car in the past five years and your car was involved in a Rogue Loop (RL) incident, you may be entitled to compensation under a settlement to a class-action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.

A Rogue Loop is defined by the Court as a state where a self-driving car appears to disregard humans and continues to drive around, refueling itself when necessary, and ignoring orders to stop.

If you believe your self-driving car has experienced this condition in the last five years, please contact us for more information on how to submit a claim.
