Subject: Sandwich assembler??

Yo dogs. I was out drinking last night and realized: You know what Americans love? SANDWICHES. Am I right. Americans can’t get enough sandwiches. I sketched out a quick design for a patriotic sandwich machine where you put in white bread, baloney, mustard. It could play a song when it finishes. Haha!

More details to come later when I’m less hung over, maybe. Ugh…

I have a keypad that will work for this, but it uses normal XBus which will block until a key is pressed.

You will figure it out.

I’m sorry. I really am trying my best to come up with good ideas, but obviously as you’ve pointed out I have more work to do in that area. Please give me another chance. I swear I’m going to redouble my efforts and work extra hard to create a successful product for you. I promise.
