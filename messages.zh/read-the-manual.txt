Subject: Важно: прочитайте инструкцию!
From: Carl Tesky <carl@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

I know… you’re so good at engineering, systems, and life in general you haven’t needed a manual in ages. Right?

Well, trust me on this one: You really, really, really, really really want to read the manual here. 

Even better if you keep it handy as you work.

Don’t be like the non-manual-using person who quit just before you started and whose name shall never be uttered again...
