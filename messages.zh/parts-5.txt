Subject: What is this?

Anyone ever heard of the PGA33X6? A pushy stall vendor nearly stuffed these in my pockets as I was walking through Hua Qiang Bei last night. No idea what he was saying. “Have some naff undocumented chips,” I suppose.

Well, I guess we have a bunch of them now, if anyone can figure out how to make use of it.
