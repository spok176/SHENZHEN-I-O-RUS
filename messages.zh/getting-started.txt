Dear Engineer,

I am pleased to welcome you to the Independent Principality of Avalon City. Now that you are situated here, you are doubtless wondering how to begin contributing to our efforts.

It may take you some getting used to, but employee-citizens of Avalon City are expected to organize themselves into project-based teams as needs arise. There are no pointless hierarchies or org charts here; achieving the goals of our high-level development plans is the only thing that matters.

A key goal as we finish initial construction is to achieve complete self-sufficiency. The less we depend on imports, the less leverage other nations have with us, which will reduce the friction involved in gaining full diplomatic recognition. Research and development is already underway in key disciplines to support this objective, including marine science and biology, electronics and software, and manufacturing and construction.

The people involved in these efforts will begin reaching out to you soon.

Sun Haotian
President, Avalon City
