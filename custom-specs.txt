Subject: Custom specifications

Ever wonder where the specs you test against come from? Well, we use a little program called conceptSPEC to generate them.

I figure you're ready to create your own specs if you want, so I put a link on your desktop.

conceptSPEC isn't exactly the most elegant program, but it'll do. Since, you know, there's no choice.

Just remember that good specifications result in good designs. Poor specifications result in poor designs.

Maybe one day, you will take my job.

I have been doing this for almost forty years. So, maybe after another forty years, I will get tired.
