Subject: Tag, you're it

Please don’t blame me for this.

I have a friend-- more like an acquaintance, really-- from a while back, many jobs ago. He’s always been a bit of a nutter and I guess what happened was he made a decent bit of cash with an app or something and decided to retire from the programmer’s life and build laser tag arenas for the rest of his days.

That’s not the worst of it. He’s calling his franchise-to-be the AWESOMEPLEX (capitals his).

In any case, he wanted to see if we could make some scorekeeping wearables for it and I said yes. I’m not entirely sure why. I suppose in the unlikely event his arenas do take off, it’ll look brilliant in hindsight.

AWESOMEPLEX!!!

When it’s done we should try a match in the office! Laser tag looks like so much fun.

A lot of simple inputs, either on or off. Too many for a microcontroller on its own but a good use for the DX300.

Joe, it would be great if you focused on business instead of constantly suggesting distractions.

Also, I would destroy you.

Just got word from my friend. He’s purchased the building for his first… I can’t bring myself to write it out. His first location. Not sure I want to imagine how much of his retirement he’s put into it.

It’s always nice to have a dream, but sometimes there’s a reason you shouldn’t pursue it, you know?
