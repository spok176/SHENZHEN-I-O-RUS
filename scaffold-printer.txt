Dr. Suemura has been working on the design of a printable lattice for neural processing units that weaves a growth medium around a nanoscale trellis-like structure. We now need to devise a process to produce them, which is where you come in.

Let me know as soon as the device is ready so we can put these into manufacturing immediately.
